Operational Systems- Any system that an organisation uses to manage their business which can also be use to manage data.E.G Laptop ued by supermarket to record sales & profits. Youtube, used by organisations to train people etc.

2. Transformation- This is whe you change ddata to how you want it and make it analysis ready.
