ETL is everything you do up to the point of analysis.
1. Extract- You are connecting to the data source to extract data ( data source or satbse can be either on premises or on cloud)
2. Transform- After extracting the data, you then transform to the structure that you need for analysis.
3. Load- Move your clean data which is analysis ready to your analysis tool which can be Power Bi or Excel.
ETL Tools for microsoft is Power Query, it works with Excel and Power Bi
### Data Analysis Life Cycle
1. Ingest Data- This means to get your data from your data source into th etool for data transformation.
2. Transformation- This is whe you change ddata to how you want it and make it analysis ready.
